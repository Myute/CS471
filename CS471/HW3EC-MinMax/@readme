  Run my minmax.out first for a binary version.
  Make this tri-nary.
  Each level has 3^L nodes.
  Your Ops are not just L and R.
  Display in a nice format as I did.

  For realMM.out (Special EC)
   you need a complete binary tree class
   that creates a balanced (triangular) tree.
   And allows the user to assign scores to leaves.
   And then perform MinMax in a DFS matter.
   
   My readlMM.cpp is given as a sample.
